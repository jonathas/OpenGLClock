A clock developed with C++ and OpenGL

In order to compile it, you need to check if glut.h is installed in your system.

In Fedora, for example, you can install it with this command:

# yum install freeglut freeglut-devel

Then, 

$ chmod +x compile.sh

and run it:

./compile.sh

If there are no error messages, just run the compiled app:

./clock
